<h2 id="coursedescription">Course description</h2>

<p>How does the geography of New York City shape the literature of New
York City? Does the literature shape the geography in return? In this
course, we aim to understand the spatiotemporality of the Big Apple
through novels of the 20th and 21st centuries that recreate and react
to it. Not only will we read spatially, however, but we will also
create spatially. Students will make maps that launch projects of
geographical storytelling as a mode of literary analysis. More
concretely, we will build online data repositories and exhibits (using
JavaScript and HTML) that synthesize our reading and mapping
practices. No previous programming knowledge is needed, but a
curiosity and interest in puzzle solving is. </p>

<h2 id="courserequirementspolicies">Course requirements &amp; policies</h2>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<h4 id="participation">Participation</h4>

<p><strong>25%</strong> The success of any course is directly related to the levels of engagement
brought both by the instructor and the students. As such, class participation
is vitally important. Similarly, though attendance is logically required for
class participation, it is not sufficient. This class requires active
participation both inside the classroom and outside. </p>

<p>You can miss up to three meetings without penalty, and you can use these
opportunities tactically, to provide space and time to either fulfill other
obligations or recuperate from the previous night. I don’t care why you didn’t
come. I start to care with the fourth absence, and I start to require
documentation. Repeated unexcused absence quickly gobbles up the class
participation component of the grade and begins to threaten your ability to
even <em>pass</em> the course.</p>

<p>In a discussion-oriented class, “active participation” involves the following
components. All of these are necessary to receive maximum points for
participation:</p>

<ul>
<li>being in class on time and staying in the classroom,</li>
<li>arriving having done the reading for that day,</li>
<li>having considered the reading and found points of entry into class discussion via questions about specific passages,</li>
<li>participating in class discussion in ways that build upon contributions from others, and</li>
<li>refraining from the use of electronic devices.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="javascripthomework">JavaScript Homework</h4>

<p><strong>15%</strong> Every week, for the Wednesday class, the respective problem set for
that week in <em>The JavaScripting English Major</em> will be due. The answers should
be emailed to me before class on Wednesday, and you should bring your homework
to class on Wednesday as well.</p>

<h4 id="dérives">Dérives</h4>

<p><strong>20%</strong> You will undertake two dérives during the semester. In both, you will
get lost in Manhattan (and beyond?), while also documenting and tracking
yourself. In order to direct your dérive, you will use either an app for your
smartphone or a set of cards printed out ahead of time. In order to track the
dérive, you are required to trace your path and take notes on a Field Papers
atlas and, if possible, track yourself using GPS.</p>

<p>During the course of the dérive, which can last hours, you should reflect on
the readings we have already done for the class, both in what you observe
while getting lost, but also in the process of getting lost itself.</p>

<p>At the end, you will write up a short (1,100&#8211;1,250 words) report for each
dérive, including textual references from our readings. The report will be
joined by the original Field Papers atlas with notes. You can and are
encouraged to use other forms of media to supplement the report.</p>

<p>Finally, you will create a Leaflet map tracing your two dérives, to be hosted
on GitHub.</p>

<h4 id="presentation">Presentation</h4>

<p><strong>10%</strong> You will give a short presentation on one of the novels we
are reading. This presentation should be about five minutes long and introduce
another writer’s views on the novel. Usually, this means looking up a book
review. Most of the books will have been reviewed by at least one of the <em>New
York Times</em> or <em>New York Review of Books</em>, but you can look for other reviews
from newspapers and magazines. The presentation should summarize the review
and include your thoughts on the review having read (at least some of) the
novel in question.</p>

<h4 id="finalproject">Final project</h4>

<p><strong>30%</strong> Throughout the semester, you will be building a project based on one
of the novels in the class and its relationship to New York City. This project
will be a website, hosted on GitHub. Because it must contain at least one
Leaflet map, thematically the project will benefit from tracing certain
geographies in the novel of your choice and reproducing them online. The
result of the project should not be a fixed conclusion, but, rather, a new
series of questions prompted by your thinking about the novel geographically.
That is, what does the map you create tell you about the novel that you did
not previously know? What kinds of future avenues of inquiry open up because
of it?</p>

<p>You should be thinking about the project as early as possible, even
considering from the discussion on the first day which novel you may want to
choose for your focus and jumping ahead on it. Right before Thanksgiving, you
will send me a short outline of the project, a précis, that describes the
structure of the site, the content, and what kinds of questions you will be
investigating. During the last week of the course, we will have time in class
to troubleshoot technical problems, and on the last class, you will give a
quick, five-minute presentation about your project. Over the next week, you
will complete the project.</p>

<p>Hitting every deadline is crucial, so being late on any of these three points
(précis, presentation, final submission) will hurt your final grade. </p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<h4 id="assignments">Assignments</h4>

<p>The assignment instructions, though detailed in the syllabus, may be enhanced
or supplemented during the course. If you have any questions about an
assignment, you should ask for clarification early. The assignments are due on
the dates noted in the syllabus. </p>

<p>The writing can be submitted electronically, <em>except</em> for the second essay and
its rewrite, which must be submitted in paper form. I prefer 2up (two pages per
sheet), two-sided printing. Documents should be formatted sanely: 12pt type and
double-spaced.</p>

<p>Late assignments jeopardize both your and my rhythms in the class, so they will
be penalized. I will give you feedback and will happily discuss any work with
you, but grades should be considered final.</p>

<h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>

<p>As indicated above, attendance is required. Three absences will be excused
without supplemental documentation, and I encourage you to use these
tactically. Catching up is your responsibility.</p>

<p>Subsequent absence requires formal documentation. Otherwise it begins to harm
your final grade. Though class participation is only part of the final grade,
extreme absenteeism (more than six meetings missed) will put your ability to
pass the course at risk.</p>

<p>Please show up on time to class, as well.</p>

<h4 id="electronics">Electronics</h4>

<p>Our time in class is meant as a sanctuary from the distractions of the rest of
the world. Additionally, our class relies on discussion and engagement, and the
front of a laptop screen is a brilliant shield behind which a student can hide,
even unintentionally. During our meetings, then, there can be no use of
electronic devices. Please also set whatever devices you have but aren’t using
to silent mode.</p>

<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>

<p>Communication is vitally important to the pedagogical process, and this course
depends on clear communication in both directions. If you have questions,
comments, or concerns, the best course of action is to come visit me during my
office hours as noted at the top of this document. If your questions, etc., cannot
wait until then, then clearly you can also email me. I should respond within
48 hours, but please write again if I do not.</p>

<p>This is a new course, meaning that there will be even more unfinished edges
ready to scratch someone than in a typical course. We have a collective goal of
learning, however, so if the unfinished edges get to be overwhelming, I’ll
adjust the parameters of the course appropriately. I’m not out to catch you,
nor is this course a process of grotesque punishment. Please don’t treat it as
such.</p>

<p>Once more, with feeling: <em>communication is vitally important to the pedagogical
process</em>. If you have concerns or worries, please let me know about them sooner
rather than later.</p>

<h4 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h4>

<p>If you have a disability, you should register with the Moses Center for
Students with Disabilities (mosescsd@nyu.edu; 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor,
212.998.4980), which can arrange for things like extra time for assignments.
Please inform me <em>at the beginning of the semester</em> if you need any special
accommodations regarding the assignments.</p>

<h4 id="academicintegrity">Academic integrity</h4>

<p>Please look at NYU’s <a href="http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity">full statement on academic
integrity</a>. Any instance of
academic dishonesty will result in an F and will be reported to the relevant
dean for disciplinary action. Remember that plagiarism is a matter of fact, not
intention. Know what it is, and don’t do it.</p>
