#### Plenary sessions

English 101 features four plenary sessions led by four faculty members in the
English department. With these sessions, the faculty will give you the
opportunity to be exposed both to the diverse set of interests that occupy our
department as well as the diverse faculty itself. Each faculty member will be
presenting on work that we will have read in class. The plenaries are scheduled
for Thursdays and Fridays, as noted below. 

#### Participation

**20%** The success of any course is directly related to the levels of engagement
brought both by the instructor and the students. As such, class participation
is vitally important. Similarly, though attendance is logically required for
class participation, it is not sufficient. This class requires active
participation both inside the classroom and outside. No “passive consumers,” as
a professor of mine put it. 
  
You can miss up to three meetings without penalty, and you can use these
opportunities tactically, to provide space and time to either fulfill other
obligations or recuperate from the previous night. I don’t care why you didn’t
come. I start to care with the fourth absence, and I start to require
documentation. Repeated unexcused absence quickly gobbles up the class
participation component of the grade and begins to threaten your ability to
even *pass* the course.

Plenaries *cannot be missed*.

Because this course is discussion-oriented, active participation means, most
importantly, participating in the discussions in class. But useful and engaged
participation in discussions also depends on good preparation, which includes
doing the reading for the course. I encourage (but will not collect) you to
think of one or two points of entry into a discussion of a text for each
meeting. This could be a point of confusion (don’t be shy!), a point of
comparison/contrast between passages to another work, or a useful parallel to
something outside the coursework. Come to class with questions, in other words,
and writing them out as mini-prompts may be especially helpful.

#### First essay

**15%** The first essay will be in response to a prompt. It should be 900–1200 words
long.

#### Second essay

**10%** The second essay features a reading of a passage from a work we have read for
class. You should show the passage’s importance to the text as a whole. This
essay should also be 900–1200 words long.

#### Second essay rewrite

**10%** The rewrite of the second essay is an opportunity to build upon the
second essay by incorporating some of the additional texts you have been
exposed to in the presentations. This rewrite should be 1200–1500 words
long.

#### Presentation

**20%** Throughout the semester, secondary texts have been paired with with primary
reading for that day. Once during the semester, you will have to choose a
secondary text and present on it. The presentation should be 10–15 minutes
long. It should provide context for the secondary text itself, a summary of the
secondary text, and close with suggestions towards how the secondary text
enhances our understanding of that day’s primary text. The presentation will be
accompanied by a short document laying out the same information as the
presentation did.

#### Final essay

**25%** The final essay is a critical work on one of the primary texts we have
    read. It should build on the reading techniques from the first two essays
    as well as make use of one of the secondary texts from the course.
    Additionally, it should include some added research, aided by the skills
    learned at the library.
