How does the geography of New York City shape the literature of New
York City? Does the literature shape the geography in return? In this
course, we aim to understand the spatiotemporality of the Big Apple
through novels of the 20th and 21st centuries that recreate and react
to it. Not only will we read spatially, however, but we will also
create spatially. Students will make maps that launch projects of
geographical storytelling as a mode of literary analysis. More
concretely, we will build online data repositories and exhibits (using
JavaScript and HTML) that synthesize our reading and mapping
practices. No previous programming knowledge is needed, but a
curiosity and interest in puzzle solving is.
