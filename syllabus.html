<h2 id="coursedescription">Course description</h2>

<p>Designed for English majors and minors, this course examines three intertwined
questions: What is literature? Why do we read it? and How do we read it? As we
will see, any attempt to answer these three questions will take us through
various historical, spatial, political, and cultural fields. More precisely,
the course will follow a path of engaging with primarily American,
English-language aesthetic objects (poems, plays, novels, short stories,
essays—while also incorporating films and other, “newer” technologies of
aesthetic production) alongside a wider scholarly apparatus that has tried to
codify, restrict, (de)politicize, champion, demystify, appropriate, critique,
quantify, or simply complicate those objects. In so doing, we will see how the
study of literature has several histories, geographies, and politics in its
relationship with various cultures.</p>

<h2 id="courserequirementspolicies">Course requirements &amp; policies</h2>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<h4 id="plenarysessions">Plenary sessions</h4>

<p>English 101 features four plenary sessions led by four faculty members in the
English department. With these sessions, the faculty will give you the
opportunity to be exposed both to the diverse set of interests that occupy our
department as well as the diverse faculty itself. Each faculty member will be
presenting on work that we will have read in class. The plenaries are scheduled
for Thursdays and Fridays, as noted below. </p>

<h4 id="participation">Participation</h4>

<p><strong>20%</strong> The success of any course is directly related to the levels of engagement
brought both by the instructor and the students. As such, class participation
is vitally important. Similarly, though attendance is logically required for
class participation, it is not sufficient. This class requires active
participation both inside the classroom and outside. No “passive consumers,” as
a professor of mine put it. </p>

<p>You can miss up to three meetings without penalty, and you can use these
opportunities tactically, to provide space and time to either fulfill other
obligations or recuperate from the previous night. I don’t care why you didn’t
come. I start to care with the fourth absence, and I start to require
documentation. Repeated unexcused absence quickly gobbles up the class
participation component of the grade and begins to threaten your ability to
even <em>pass</em> the course.</p>

<p>Plenaries <em>cannot be missed</em>.</p>

<p>Because this course is discussion-oriented, active participation means, most
importantly, participating in the discussions in class. But useful and engaged
participation in discussions also depends on good preparation, which includes
doing the reading for the course. I encourage (but will not collect) you to
think of one or two points of entry into a discussion of a text for each
meeting. This could be a point of confusion (don’t be shy!), a point of
comparison/contrast between passages to another work, or a useful parallel to
something outside the coursework. Come to class with questions, in other words,
and writing them out as mini-prompts may be especially helpful.</p>

<h4 id="firstessay">First essay</h4>

<p><strong>15%</strong> The first essay will be in response to a prompt. It should be 900–1200 words
long.</p>

<h4 id="secondessay">Second essay</h4>

<p><strong>10%</strong> The second essay features a reading of a passage from a work we have read for
class. You should show the passage’s importance to the text as a whole. This
essay should also be 900–1200 words long.</p>

<h4 id="secondessayrewrite">Second essay rewrite</h4>

<p><strong>10%</strong> The rewrite of the second essay is an opportunity to build upon the
second essay by incorporating some of the additional texts you have been
exposed to in the presentations. This rewrite should be 1200–1500 words
long.</p>

<h4 id="presentation">Presentation</h4>

<p><strong>20%</strong> Throughout the semester, secondary texts have been paired with with primary
reading for that day. Once during the semester, you will have to choose a
secondary text and present on it. The presentation should be 10–15 minutes
long. It should provide context for the secondary text itself, a summary of the
secondary text, and close with suggestions towards how the secondary text
enhances our understanding of that day’s primary text. The presentation will be
accompanied by a short document laying out the same information as the
presentation did.</p>

<h4 id="finalessay">Final essay</h4>

<p><strong>25%</strong> The final essay is a critical work on one of the primary texts we have
 read. It should build on the reading techniques from the first two essays
 as well as make use of one of the secondary texts from the course.
 Additionally, it should include some added research, aided by the skills
 learned at the library. </p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<h4 id="assignments">Assignments</h4>

<p>The assignment instructions, though detailed in the syllabus, may be enhanced
or supplemented during the course. If you have any questions about an
assignment, you should ask for clarification early. The assignments are due on
the dates noted in the syllabus. </p>

<p>All of the writing can be submitted electronically.</p>

<p>Late assignments jeopardize both your and my rhythms in the class, so they will
be penalized. I will give you feedback and will happily discuss any work with
you, but grades should be considered final.</p>

<h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>

<p>As indicated above, attendance is required. Three absences will be excused
without supplemental documentation, and I encourage you to use these
tactically. Catching up is your responsibility.</p>

<p>Subsequent absence requires formal documentation. Otherwise it begins to harm
your final grade. Though class participation is only part of the final grade,
extreme absenteeism (more than six meetings missed) will put your ability to
pass the course at risk.</p>

<p>Please show up on time to class, as well.</p>

<h4 id="electronics">Electronics</h4>

<p>Our time in class is meant as a sanctuary from the distractions of the rest of
the world. Additionally, our class relies on discussion and engagement, and the
front of a laptop screen is a brilliant shield behind which a student can hide,
even unintentionally. During our meetings, then, there can be no use of
electronic devices. Please also set whatever devices you have but aren’t using
to silent mode.</p>

<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>

<p>Communication is vitally important to the pedagogical process, and this course
depends on clear communication in both directions. If you have questions,
comments, or concerns, the best course of action is to come visit me during my
office hours as noted at the top of this page. If your questions, etc., cannot
wait until then, then clearly you can also email me. I should respond within
48 hours, but please write again if I do not.</p>

<p>This is a new course, meaning that there will be even more unfinished edges
ready to scratch someone than in a typical course. We have a collective goal of
learning, however, so if the unfinished edges get to be overwhelming, I’ll
adjust the parameters of the course appropriately. I’m not out to catch you,
nor is this course a process of grotesque punishment. Please don’t treat it as
such.</p>

<p>Once more, with feeling: <em>communication is vitally important to the pedagogical
process</em>. If you have concerns or worries, please let me know about them sooner
rather than later.</p>

<h4 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h4>

<p>If you have a disability, you should register with the Moses Center for
Students with Disabilities (mosescsd@nyu.edu; 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor,
212.998.4980), which can arrange for things like extra time for assignments.
Please inform me <em>at the beginning of the semester</em> if you need any special
accommodations regarding the assignments.</p>

<h4 id="academicintegrity">Academic integrity</h4>

<p>Please look at NYU’s <a href="http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity">full statement on academic
integrity</a>. Any instance of
academic dishonesty will result in an F and will be reported to the relevant
dean for disciplinary action. Remember that plagiarism is a matter of fact, not
intention. Know what it is, and don’t do it.</p>

<h4 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h4>
